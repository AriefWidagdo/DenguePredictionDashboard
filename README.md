# Dengue Prediction Dashboard

A prototype dashboard for predicting dengue outbreaks using publicly available data and machine learning modeling with XGBoost.

## Overview

This project aims to provide an early warning system for dengue fever by leveraging historical data and advanced machine learning techniques. The core of the predictive model is built using the XGBoost algorithm, known for its performance and accuracy in handling structured data.

The dashboard provides an interactive interface to visualize predictions and explore the underlying data.

**Note:** The dashboard requires JavaScript to be enabled in your browser to function properly.

## Features

*   **Dengue Prediction:** Uses an XGBoost model to forecast potential dengue cases.
*   **Interactive Visualizations:** Explore trends and predictions through user-friendly charts and graphs.
*   **Public Data Integration:** Leverages available public datasets relevant to dengue forecasting (e.g., climate data, historical case reports).

## Technology Stack

*   **Python:** Core programming language.
*   **XGBoost:** Machine learning model for prediction.
*   **Streamlit:** Framework for building the interactive web dashboard.
*   **Pandas, NumPy:** Data manipulation and analysis.
*   **Scikit-learn:** For data preprocessing and model evaluation (if used).
*   **Plotly/Altair/Matplotlib:** Libraries for creating visualizations.
